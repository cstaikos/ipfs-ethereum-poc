# Solidity + IPFS POC
This is a simple project where I'm messing around with Vue.js, Solidity, and IPFS to connect them all together and learn how they work.

# Requirements
- npm / Node
- Truffle framework (http://truffleframework.com/)

# To see it in action

#### Start local emulated blockchain
`ganache-cli`

#### Deploy smart contracts
`make deploy`

#### If you'd like, run the tests
`truffle test`

#### Open index.html in your browser
`open index.html`
